# stock_market_prediction
This repository provides a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for predicting stock prices using historical market data. It preprocesses time series data and trains an LSTM neural network to forecast future stock prices based on past trends. Ideal for time series analysis and financial forecasting.

DATA  :  Historical stock prices (e.g., closing price) are preprocessed using Min-Max Scaling.
MODEL : An LSTM-based architecture trained to predict future stock prices based on past trends.
TRAINING : The model is optimized using the Adam optimizer and evaluated with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.
USAGE : The model can predict future stock prices given historical data.
